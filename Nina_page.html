  <h2>GAP 3 ‚Äì White √©migr√© (Q152538)</h2>

  <p>
    We noticed that the Wikidata profile makes no mention of one of the most important events of his life: <b> fleeing Russia during when he was 19 years old during the Civil War. </b> This specific type of emigration, which is called <b> ‚ÄúWhite emigration‚Äù</b>, influenced him and his work for the rest of his life, therefore it is very relevant information. We used LLM tools to confirm this, then used SPARQL queries to figure out how to better express this information. Finally we used ChatGPT to generate the correct RDF triples. 
  </p>

  <!-- Moved LLM PROMPTING section here -->
  <h3 style="margin-top: 60px;">LLM PROMPTING</h3>

  <p>
   First, we asked two LLMs what was the most significant event in Nabokov's life, using <b> ZERO SHOT PROMPTING </b> technique. Both were factually correct, but we preferred ChatGPT‚Äôs answer, since it was more detailed and offered multiple examples. 
  </p>

        <td>
         The most significant event in Vladimir Nabokov's life ‚Äî both personally and artistically ‚Äî is widely considered to be his emigration from Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1919.
<p>
  üá∑üá∫‚û°üá™üá∫‚û°üá∫üá∏ Why this was so significant: </p>
          <p> <b> 1. Loss of Homeland and Identity: </b>
Nabokov came from an aristocratic Russian family. His father was a liberal politician who opposed both the Tsar and the Bolsheviks. The Revolution forced the family to flee to Western Europe ‚Äî first to Crimea, then England, then Germany and France. This exile deeply shaped Nabokov‚Äôs sense of loss, memory, and displacement, themes that recur throughout his work (especially in novels like The Gift, Pnin, and Speak, Memory). </p>
          <p> <b> 2. Formation of His Literary Identity: </b>
‚Ä¢ As a result of exile, Nabokov became a trilingual writer: first writing in Russian, then English, and later translating his own work between the two.
‚Ä¢ His dual cultural identity gave his prose a unique richness and a kind of ironic detachment that became his hallmark. </p>
          <p> <b> 3. Exile as Creative Fuel: </b>
‚Ä¢ His masterpiece memoir, Speak, Memory, revolves around this loss and transformation.
‚Ä¢ Many of his characters (e.g., in The Real Life of Sebastian Knight or Pnin) are √©migr√©s or displaced intellectuals navigating alien landscapes ‚Äî directly echoing his own experience. </p>

          <p> <b> Honorable Mentions ‚Äî Other Major Life Events:</b>
<p> <b> ‚Ä¢ Marriage to V√©ra Slonim (1925): </b>She became his lifelong partner, translator, and manager. Their relationship was central to his personal and professional stability. </p>
<p> <b> ‚Ä¢ Move to the U.S. (1940):</b> He found refuge from Nazi-occupied Europe and eventually became a professor at Cornell, where he wrote Lolita.
<p> <b> ‚Ä¢ Publication of Lolita (1955):</b> This was his international breakthrough, securing his financial independence and literary fame.
<p> <b> ‚Ä¢ Return to Europe (Montreux, Switzerland) in 1961):</b> He lived out the rest of his life in a hotel by Lake Geneva, enjoying the stability he lacked in earlier decades.

<p> <b> Final Answer:</b>
The emigration from Russia in 1919 was the most significant event in Nabokov‚Äôs life ‚Äî it not only transformed his worldview but became the foundation of his literary identity and themes.

        </td>
        <td>
         There are two events that are consistently cited as the most significant in Vladimir Nabokov's life, and their impact is intertwined:
          <p><b>The Bolshevik Revolution and his family's subsequent exile from Russia:</b> Nabokov was born into a wealthy, aristocratic family in St. Petersburg and had a "perfect" and "cosmopolitan" childhood. The 1917 revolution and the family's flight from their homeland in 1919 meant the loss of their fortune, their home, and their culture. This exile profoundly shaped his art, making memory and the concept of "unreal estate" (the world of his childhood preserved in his mind) a central theme throughout his career. </p>
          <p><b> The assassination of his father, Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov: </b> In 1922, while the family was living in Berlin, his father‚Äîa prominent liberal politician‚Äîwas assassinated by right-wing reactionaries. The assassins were attempting to kill another man, and Nabokov's father was shot while shielding him. Although Nabokov publicly disclaimed any direct influence of this event on his work, the theme of a mistaken or senseless assassination appears prominently in his novels. </p>
While the exile from Russia fundamentally altered the course of his life and gave him the subject matter for much of his writing, the death of his father was a deeply personal trauma that also resonated in his work. These two events, both stemming from the political turmoil of his time, stripped away his privileged world and forced him to become an exile who would later reinvent himself as a literary genius in a new language.
