We noticed that the object under “influenced by” (P737) is deprecated. On wikidata, a triple statement can be deprecated for a variety, such as being no longer true or having an unreliable source, such as this case. As a result, it doesn’t show up when you query it. 
To be sure, we ran a query, comparing Nabokov’s information with that of a similar writer, Joseph Brodsky (Q862), to see which objects they have under the property “influenced by” (P737). We used the keyword OPTIONAL so the results would show up even if the triple pattern doesn’t exist.

          Having identified this gap, we asked ChatGPT and Gemini what Nabokov’s main influences were, using a FEW SHOT PROMPTING technique, providing it examples to follow.

          The Theatre of Marcellus was constructed during the late Roman Republic period. It was initiated by Julius Caesar and completed under Emperor Augustus.
        </td>
        <td>
          The Theatre of Marcellus was begun by Julius Caesar, but it was completed and dedicated by Augustus in 13 BC. Augustus named the theatre in memory of his nephew, Marcus Claudius Marcellus.
        </td>
      </tr>
      In the result of comparing the two answers from the LLMs it can be noted that they both give quite the same information. They both mention Julius Caesar as the initiator of the constuction, which indeed might be a fair point to be noted. The difference in answers lies in the additional information the LLMs provide. They both mention the approximate date (<i>the late Roman Republic period</i> – ChatGPT; <i>13 BC</i> – Gemini), and also Gemini adds information on the naming of the theatre. It was not the aim of the zero-shot prompting to retrieve this information, it is thus excessive.
